# Root Cause Analysis Quality Judge

Evaluate the quality of root cause analysis produced by the pipeline-rca skill. Score 1-5.

## Inputs

You will receive:
- **Generated output**: The `finding.json`, `sections/error-overview.md`, `sections/root-cause.md`, and optionally `sections/resolution.md` and `sections/feedback.md`
- **Reference**: The `reference.md` describing the expected root cause and analysis approach
- **Workspace files**: The trace logs, error files, and context files that were input to the skill

## Scoring Rubric

### 5 — Excellent
- Root cause correctly identified with strong supporting evidence
- Confidence level matches the strength of available evidence
- Error overview concisely presents the symptom with properly quoted error messages
- Root cause section provides thorough diagnosis explaining why the failure occurred
- Resolution (when applicable) is specific, actionable, and correctly targeted
- All consulted files tracked in references
- finding.json fields are accurate and internally consistent

### 4 — Good
- Root cause correctly identified
- Confidence level reasonable (within one level of expected)
- Error overview presents the key errors clearly
- Root cause section explains the diagnosis with supporting evidence
- Resolution provides a reasonable fix approach
- Most references tracked
- finding.json mostly accurate

### 3 — Acceptable
- Root cause partially identified — correct general area but missing specifics
- Confidence level somewhat appropriate
- Error overview exists but may miss key error messages or include too much noise
- Root cause section provides analysis but may be shallow or partially incorrect
- Resolution exists but may be vague or not fully actionable
- Some references missing
- finding.json has minor inaccuracies

### 2 — Poor
- Root cause misidentified or only the surface symptom described
- Confidence level inappropriate for the evidence
- Error overview missing or poorly structured
- Root cause section is speculative without supporting evidence
- Resolution is wrong or not actionable
- References largely missing
- finding.json has significant errors

### 1 — Failing
- No meaningful analysis produced
- finding.json missing or severely malformed
- Section files missing or empty
- Root cause completely wrong or not attempted

## Evaluation Focus

1. **Diagnostic accuracy**: Does the analysis correctly identify WHY the failure occurred, not just WHAT error appeared? The error overview should present symptoms; the root cause section should explain the underlying cause.

2. **Evidence quality**: Does the analysis cite specific log lines, file paths, or configuration values that support the diagnosis? Unsupported claims lower the score.

3. **Confidence calibration**: Is the confidence level appropriate? High confidence should be reserved for cases with direct evidence (error message names the cause, artifact inspection confirms it). Medium for pattern-based inference. Low for ambiguous situations.

4. **Section structure**: Error overview should be concise (5-20 lines) with quoted errors in ```error blocks. Root cause should be analytical, not just repeating the errors. Resolution should include specific file paths and proposed changes.

5. **finding.json completeness**: Are all required fields present and accurate? Do collections, actions, and group_consistency match the actual analysis? Is cascade correctly identified?

6. **Actionability**: When a resolution is provided, can an engineer follow the instructions to fix the issue? Are file paths canonical? Are alternatives and caveats noted?
